## How to Cook Sausage in an Air Fryer: Step-by-Step Guide

Cooking **sausage in air fryer** is straightforward, but a few tips ensure perfect results. Follow this step-by-step guide for juicy, golden-brown sausages every time.

### Step 1: Preheat Your Air Fryer
Preheating is crucial for even cooking. Set your air fryer to 360-400°F (182-204°C) for 3-5 minutes. Preheating prevents sticking and ensures a crispy exterior.

### Step 2: Prepare the Sausages
- **Optional Piercing**: Some recipes suggest piercing sausages to release fat, but this can dry them out. For juicier results, skip piercing unless you prefer less fat.
- **Arrange Evenly**: Place sausages in a single layer in the air fryer basket, leaving space for air circulation. Avoid overcrowding to ensure even browning.

### Step 3: Set the Cooking Time and Temperature
Cooking times vary based on sausage type and thickness. Here’s a quick guide:
- **Breakfast Sausages**: 6-8 minutes at 360°F, flipping halfway.
- **Italian Sausages**: 10-12 minutes at 400°F, flipping halfway.
- **Bratwurst**: 12-15 minutes at 380°F, flipping halfway.
- **Smoked Sausages**: 8-10 minutes at 360°F, no flipping needed.
- **Hot Dogs**: 3-5 minutes at 400°F.

Always check the internal temperature with a meat thermometer. Sausages should reach 160°F (71°C) for pork or 165°F (74°C) for poultry to be safe.

### Step 4: Check for Doneness
Cut into one sausage to ensure it’s not pink inside. If needed, cook for an additional 1-2 minutes. Overcooking can dry out sausages, so keep an eye on the time.

### Step 5: Serve and Enjoy
Remove sausages with tongs and let them rest for 1-2 minutes to lock in juices. Serve as desired—on buns, with sides, or sliced into recipes.

## Tips for the Best Air Fryer Sausage Recipe

- **Experiment with Flavors**: Brush sausages with olive oil, garlic, or herbs before cooking for extra flavor.
